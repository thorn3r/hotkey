# Hotkey 🔥🗝️

## Description
This is a basic util script that can be used to hotkey application windows. The script takes a single argument, the name of the application, and it will attempt to switch focus to an open window, if one exists, or open the application if it doesn't.

This script can be used to setup custom hotkeys if your DE supports this:
